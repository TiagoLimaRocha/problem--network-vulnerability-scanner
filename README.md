# Problem: Asynchronous Network Vulnerability Scanner

## Background

You are developing a tool for a cybersecurity team that asynchronously scans various network assets for vulnerabilities. Each asset type (e.g., servers, workstations, network devices) requires a different scanning technique and reports vulnerabilities in its format. Your task is to implement a system that orchestrates these scans, processes the results, and provides a summary of vulnerabilities found across the network.

## Task

- **Asynchronous Scanning Functions:** Create functions to simulate scanning different types of assets (servers, workstations, network devices). Each function should return a promise that resolves with mock vulnerability data specific to the asset type.

- **Scan Result Processing Function:** Implement a function processScanResults that takes the raw vulnerability data from each scan and extracts key information (e.g., severity, affected asset, suggested remediation).

- **Vulnerability Summary Function:** Create a function summarizeVulnerabilities that takes processed scan results and provides a summary report, including the number of vulnerabilities by severity and type.

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for scenarios like scan failures or timeouts.

- **TypeScript Interfaces:** Define TypeScript interfaces for the raw scan results, processed information, and the summary report.

- **Testing:** Write test cases to demonstrate that your scanning process and result handling are working as expected, including error scenarios.

## Requirements

- Use TypeScript for the implementation.
- Simulate asynchronous vulnerability scans using async functions, Promises, or async/await.
- Ensure your code is well-organized and follows best practices.
